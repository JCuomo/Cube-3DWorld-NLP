PA2-v2.py is a python script to find a solution in the cube world.
It should be run as:
	'ipython3 PA2-v2.py <start_state_file> <goal_state_file>'

Example:
for testing there are two sample files: "start" and "goal"
and after running in the terminal:
	'ipython3 PA2-v2.py start goal'

--------------------------------------------------
A folder name "tests" will be created where all files will be saved.

The following files are gonna be saved: 

After the legend "Goal defined":
"goal_defined": goal fully defined (both coordinates and relations)
"start_defined": start fully defined (both coordinates and relations)

After the legend "Stacking relations solved":
"relations": solution on the "stack" relation level

After the legend "Steps: n":
"paths": solution on the grid level
